# Vulnerability-Scanner

Currently, I am working on an automated vulnerability scanner for websites that deeply scans websites with very few false-positive results.
Our scanner detects vulnerabilities with additional information such as open ports, whois information, DNS information, admin information, traceroute information, path information,and admin pages if websites are built with WordPress.
In the vulnerability part, our scanner detects cross-site scripting and SQL injection.
